  new Song('/music/BetterThanEzra-Good.mp3','/img/betterthanezra.jpg', 'Good', 'Better Than Ezra', '1995', 'Rock', 'The vanquished vocals and semi-quirky guitar chords of "Good" gave Better Than Ezra their quick plunge into stardom, but it wasn\'t long before the band was towel dried and then forgotten. 1995\'s Deluxe failed to administer any musical congruity, helped along only by the gear-switching tempo of "In the Blood," the second best track on the album, as well as the tempting pull of "Southern Girl." Unfortunately, beyond these songs the album falls flat, suffering from a cliched garage band/alternative band dullness. Any hints of originality are drawn into the relentless vortex of banal guitar routines and run-of-the-mill college radio grit. The lyrics are passable, but cease to secrete any interest or the same amount of sharpness as the first two singles. Better Than Ezra are just another example of a band that suffered from the redundancy of a stereotypical rock formula.', 0),
  new Song('/music/Bush-Machinehead.mp3','/img/bush.jpg', 'Machinehead', 'Bush', '1994', 'Rock', 'Bush\'s grunge-by-the-numbers is certainly well produced. Under the guidance of Clive Langer and Alan Winstanley -- the kings of early-\'80s British pop -- Bush turn in an album that follows all the rules and sounds of American hard rock, specifically Nirvana and Pearl Jam. Their songwriting isn\'t original, nor is it particularly catchy. What makes "Everything Zen" and "Little Things" memorable is the exact reproduction of all of Nirvana\'s trademarks, only with a more professional execution. In other words, all the guitars keep rhythm perfectly and Gavin Rossdale doesn\'t shred his throat when he sings, he projects from his diaphragm. As far as popcraftsmanship goes, it\'s actually quite impressive. It would be even more so if they had songs to accompany their sounds.', 1),
  new Song('/music/CountingCrows-MrJones.mp3','/img/countingcrows.jpg', 'Mr Jones', 'Counting Crows', '1993', 'Rock', 'When the prevailing guitar jingle of ”Mr. Jones” cascaded over radio in the early ’90s, it was a sure sign that the Counting Crows were a musical force to be reckoned with. Their debut album, August and Everything After, burst at the seams with both dominant pop harmonies and rich, hearty ballads, all thanks to lead singer Adam Duritz. The lone guitar work of ”Mr. Jones” coupled with the sweet, in-front pull of Duritz\'s voice kicked off the album in full force. The starkly beautiful and lonely sounding ”Round Here” captured the band’s honest yet subtle talent for singing ballads, while ”Omaha” is lyrically reminiscent of a Springsteen tune. The fusion of hauntingly smooth vocals with such instruments as the Hammond B-3 organ and the accordion pumped new life into the music scene, and their brisk sound catapulted them into stardom. On ”Rain King,” the piano takes over as its aloof flair dances behind Duritz with elegant crispness. The slower-paced ”Raining in Baltimore” paints a perfectly gray picture and illustrates the band\'s ease at conveying mood by eliminating the tempo. Most of the songs here engage in overly contagious hooks that won\'t go away, making for a solid bunch of tunes. Containing the perfect portions of instrumental and vocal conglomeration, the Counting Crows showed off their appealing sound to its full extent with their very first album.', 2),
  new Song('/music/DaveMatthewsBand-CrashIntoMe.mp3','/img/davematthewsband.jpg', 'Crash into Me', 'Dave Matthews Band', '1996', 'Rock', 'Under the Table and Dreaming, the Dave Matthews Band’s first major-label album, was their popular breakthrough, bringing their mildly eclectic sound to a mass audience. Although the group appeals to the same audience as Blues Traveler, Hootie & the Blowfish, and the Spin Doctors, the Dave Matthews Band has more influences than their peers. Fusing together folk-rock, worldbeat, jazz, and pop, the band is arguably the most musically adept of all their contemporaries. However, they have trouble coming up with engaging hooks, as their third album, Crash, proves. Although the band continues to get better -- their musical cross-breeding is effortless and seamless -- they often don’t have an attractive frame for their skills. Strangely, the lack of memorable melodies doesn’t particularly hurt the album -- it actually emphasizes the band’s instrumental talents. Nevertheless, since there’s a lack of strong pop hooks, Crash is an album that will please fans, but not novices.', 3),
  new Song('/music/Filter-HeyManNiceShot.mp3','/img/filter.jpg', 'Hey Man Nice Shot', 'Filter', '1995', 'Rock', 'Filter’s debut reflects post-Nine Inch Nails state-of-the-art industrial pop, which means Short Bus is indeed more pop than industrial. The noise accentuates the songs instead of driving them. Filter’s sense of melody is slighter than Trent Reznor’s, yet they have the skill to craft shifting dynamics into hooks, as in the single ”Hey Man, Nice Shot.” Not that they can keep it going throughout the entire record, but it still plays very well to the audience.', 4),
  new Song('/music/GinBlossoms-HeyJealousy.mp3','/img/ginblossoms.jpg', 'Hey Jealousy', 'Gin Blossoms', '1992', 'Rock', 'Released during the heyday of grunge music, New Miserable Experience remains the best and most representative document of the group’s existence, a tight and lean collection of brilliant, edgy pop music that was markedly different from the bulk of 1992’s modern rock albums. ”Hey Jealousy” and ”Until I Fall Away” are the two songs that leave the deepest impression -- and, appropriately, both were successful singles -- but the crunchy, jangled melodicism and lyrical desperation of ”Hold Me Down” is similarly notable. Two dilettantish genre pieces -- ”Cajun Song” and a country weeper called ”Cheatin’ (as in ”you can’t call it cheatin’ ’cause she reminds me of you”) -- provide the program’s two low points, but even those aren’t completely without charm.', 5),
  new Song('/music/GooGooDolls-Slide.mp3','/img/googoodolls.jpg', 'Slide', 'Goo Goo Dolls', '1995', 'Rock', 'Produced by Lou Giordano with his trademark full-bodied, immediately accessible, but never washed-out sound, A Boy Named Goo finally got the band across to a wide audience, and deservedly so. Right from the start, the Goo Goo Dolls sound perfectly on the right track after Superstar Car Wash\'s OK but ultimately go-nowhere feeling -- "Long Way Down" is another stone-cold classic of wounded romanticism wedded to catchy Cheap Trick-tinged punk-pop, Rzeznik\'s singing the not-so-secret weapon. Hearing him on the descending chorus, matching the just sad enough guitar crunch, makes one realize that there\'s always hope for full-bodied rock & roll. The eternal Replacements tag now makes less sense than ever -- the Goos have their own enjoyable sound, Rzeznik\'s a more individual singer than ever, and all three rock out accordingly. Takac similarly has his own sonic improvements, his formerly rasped high register now just a little more controlled but no less affecting, as winners like "Burnin\' Up" and "Somethin\' Bad" easily demonstrate. Rzeznik-sung highlights are equally everywhere -- the commercial but never stupid "Naked," with a great chorus and immediately radio-friendly music, the equally sharp "Only One," and the mighty fine "Ain\'t That Unusual." There\'s no question what the highlight is, though -- however untypical of the rest of the album\'s mid-range feedback fun, "Name," with its sweet but sad acoustic arrangement, made perfect sense as the Goos\' long-delayed radio breakthrough. Rzeznik\'s empathetic vocal, delivering one of his best lyrics on favored subjects of friendship, loss, and fame, matches unfolky strumming and quiet energy, creating a song that feels like both a farewell to the American Dream and to a long-lost partner. All this without sounding like a Bruce Springsteen sermon -- a rare thing indeed.', 6),
  new Song('/music/Lit-MyOwnWorstEnemy.mp3','/img/lit.jpg', 'My Own Worst Enemy', 'Lit', '1997', 'Rock', 'Often quite abrasive and dissonant, but not without melodic sensibilities, alternative rockers Lit keep listeners on their toes on the varied Tripping the Light Fantastic. Metal, thrash, punk/hardcore, and grunge are all important parts of the southern California band\'s sound, but elements of power pop and sometimes folk also assert themselves on this arresting and angst-filled release. One minute lead singer A. Jay Popoff is screaming in a tortured fashion, and the next, his vocals are very much in tune. Guitarist Jeremy Popoff can be brutal, but he also demonstrates that he knows how persuasive harmonic nuances can be on such memorable selections as the as the morbid "Bitter," the angry "Fireman," and the Middle Eastern-influenced "Habib." This is a CD that won\'t be accused of being one-dimensional.', 7),
  new Song('/music/LocalH-BoundForTheFloor.mp3','/img/localh.jpg', 'Bound For the Floor', 'Local H', '1996', 'Rock', 'As Good as Dead sounds just as brutal as its lyrics; while there\'s a graceful minor-key lyricism to quieter number like "No Problem" and "Eddie Vedder," Lucas and drummer Joe Daniels bash with an unsettling intensity on "Nothing Special" and "I Saw What You Did and I Know Who You Are." While the two sludgy slow numbers that close the album bring As Good as Dead to a disappointing conclusion, maybe it\'s appropriate -- you can\'t end an album about failure on a note of triumph, and anyone who grew up in a one-paper town will doubtless wince with recognition at the bitter hopelessness of As Good as Dead.', 8),
  new Song('/music/Metallica-NothingElseMatters.mp3','/img/metallica.jpg', 'Nothing Else Matters', 'Metallica', '1991', 'Rock', 'After the muddled production and ultracomplicated song structures of ...And Justice for All, Metallica decided that they had taken the progressive elements of their music as far as they could and that a simplification and streamlining of their sound was in order. While the assessment made sense from a musical standpoint, it also presented an opportunity to commercialize their music, and Metallica accomplishes both goals. The best songs are more melodic and immediate, the crushing, stripped-down grooves of "Enter Sandman," "Sad but True," and "Wherever I May Roam" sticking to traditional structures and using the same main riffs throughout; the crisp, professional production by Bob Rock adds to their accessibility. "The Unforgiven" and "Nothing Else Matters" avoid the slash-and-burn guitar riffs that had always punctuated the band\'s ballads; the latter is a full-fledged love song complete with string section, which works much better than might be imagined. The song- and riff-writing slips here and there, a rare occurrence for Metallica, which some longtime fans interpreted as filler next to a batch of singles calculated for commercial success. The objections were often more to the idea that Metallica was doing anything explicitly commercial, but millions more disagreed. In fact, the band\'s popularity exploded so much that most of their back catalog found mainstream acceptance in its own right, while other progressively inclined speed metal bands copied the move toward simplification. In retrospect, Metallica is a good, but not quite great, album, one whose best moments deservedly captured the heavy metal crown, but whose approach also foreshadowed a creative decline.', 9),
  new Song('/music/NineInchNails-Hurt.mp3','/img/nin.jpg', 'Hurt', 'Nine Inch Nails', '1994', 'Rock', 'The Downward Spiral positioned Trent Reznor as industrial\'s own Phil Spector, painting detailed, layered soundscapes from a wide tonal palette. Not only did he fully integrated the crashing metal guitars of Broken, but several newfound elements -- expanded song structures, odd time signatures, shifting arrangements filled with novel sounds, tremendous textural variety -- can be traced to the influence of progressive rock. So can the painstaking attention devoted to pacing and contrast -- The Downward Spiral is full of striking sonic juxtapositions and sudden about-faces in tone, which make for a fascinating listen. More important than craft in turning Reznor into a full-fledged rock star, however, was his brooding persona. Grunge had the mainstream salivating over melodramatic angst, which had always been Reznor\'s stock in trade. The left-field hit "Closer" made him a postmodern shaman for the \'90s, obsessed with exposing the dark side he saw behind even the most innocuous façades. In fact, his theatrics on The Downward Spiral -- all the preening self-absorption and serpentine sexuality -- seemed directly descended from Jim Morrison. Yet Reznor\'s nihilism often seemed like a reaction against some repressively extreme standard of purity, so the depravity he wallowed in didn\'t necessarily seem that depraved. That\'s part of the reason why, in spite of its many virtues, The Downward Spiral falls just short of being the masterpiece it wants to be. For one thing, fascination with texture occasionally dissolves the hooky songwriting that fueled Pretty Hate Machine. But more than that, Reznor\'s unflinching bleakness was beginning to seem like a carefully calibrated posture; his increasing musical sophistication points up the lyrical holding pattern. Having said that, the album ends on an affecting emotional peak -- "Hurt" mingles drama and introspection in a way Reznor had never quite managed before. It\'s evidence of depth behind the charisma that deservedly made him a star.', 10),
  new Song('/music/Nirvana-SmellsLikeTeenSpirit.mp3','/img/nirvana.jpg', 'Smells like Teen Spirit', 'Nirvana', '1991', 'Rock', 'Nevermind was never meant to change the world, but you can never predict when the Zeitgeist will hit, and Nirvana\'s second album turned out to be the place where alternative rock crashed into the mainstream. This wasn\'t entirely an accident, either, since Nirvana did sign with a major label, and they did release a record with a shiny surface, no matter how humongous the guitars sounded. And, yes, Nevermind is probably a little shinier than it should be, positively glistening with echo and fuzzbox distortion, especially when compared with the black-and-white murk of Bleach. This doesn\'t discount the record, since it\'s not only much harder than any mainstream rock of 1991, its character isn\'t on the surface, it\'s in the exhilaratingly raw music and haunting songs. Kurt Cobain\'s personal problems and subsequent suicide naturally deepen the dark undercurrents, but no matter how much anguish there is on Nevermind, it\'s bracing because he exorcizes those demons through his evocative wordplay and mangled screams -- and because the band has a tremendous, unbridled power that transcends the pain, turning into pure catharsis. And that\'s as key to the record\'s success as Cobain\'s songwriting, since Krist Novoselic and Dave Grohl help turn this into music that is gripping, powerful, and even fun (and, really, there\'s no other way to characterize "Territorial Pissings" or the surging "Breed"). In retrospect, Nevermind may seem a little too unassuming for its mythic status -- it\'s simply a great modern punk record -- but even though it may no longer seem life-changing, it is certainly life-affirming, which may just be better.', 11),
  new Song('/music/PearlJam-Black.mp3','/img/pearljam.jpg', 'Black', 'Pearl Jam', '1991', 'Rock', 'Nirvana\'s Nevermind may have been the album that broke grunge and alternative rock into the mainstream, but there\'s no underestimating the role that Pearl Jam\'s Ten played in keeping them there. Nirvana\'s appeal may have been huge, but it wasn\'t universal; rock radio still viewed them as too raw and punky, and some hard rock fans dismissed them as weird misfits. In retrospect, it\'s easy to see why Pearl Jam clicked with a mass audience -- they weren\'t as metallic as Alice in Chains or Soundgarden, and of Seattle\'s Big Four, their sound owed the greatest debt to classic rock. With its intricately arranged guitar textures and expansive harmonic vocabulary, Ten especially recalled Jimi Hendrix and Led Zeppelin. But those touchstones might not have been immediately apparent, since -- aside from Mike McCready\'s Clapton/Hendrix-style leads -- every trace of blues influence has been completely stripped from the band\'s sound. Though they rock hard, Pearl Jam is too anti-star to swagger, too self-aware to puncture the album\'s air of gravity. Pearl Jam tackles weighty topics -- abortion, homelessness, childhood traumas, gun violence, rigorous introspection -- with an earnest zeal unmatched since mid-\'80s U2, whose anthemic sound they frequently strive for. Similarly, Eddie Vedder\'s impressionistic lyrics often make their greatest impact through the passionate commitment of his delivery rather than concrete meaning. His voice had a highly distinctive timbre that perfectly fit the album\'s warm, rich sound, and that\'s part of the key -- no matter how cathartic Ten\'s tersely titled songs got, they were never abrasive enough to affect the album\'s accessibility. Ten also benefited from a long gestation period, during which the band honed the material into this tightly focused form; the result is a flawlessly crafted hard rock masterpiece.', 12),
  new Song('/music/PrimitiveRadioGods-StandingOutsideABrokenPhoneBoothWithMoneyinMyHand.mp3','/img/primitiveradiogods.jpg', 'Standing Outside A Broken Phone Booth With Money in My Hand', 'Primitive Radio Gods', '1996', 'Rock', 'Chris O\'Connor recorded the material that comprises Rocket at a friend\'s garage, releasing it independently to no fanfare. Somehow, the song "Standing Outside a Broken Phone Booth with Money in My Hand" made its way to the soundtrack for Jim Carrey\'s comedy The Cable Guy, and the tune became a surprise hit. With its loping, unthreatening hip-hop beats and its looped B.B. King sample, "Standing" had all the appeal of an adult novelty for most listeners -- it was something that was out of the ordinary, to be sure, but not something that you would want to investigate much further. Sadly, Primitive Radio Gods\' debut mini-album, Rocket, proves those doubters right. Apart from "Standing," there is precious little on the album to hold the interest of anyone drawn in by the lead single. Most of Rocket sounds exactly like somebody messing around with a four-track, more intent on capturing sounds, not songs. Usually, this would at least result in some interesting sounds, but O\'Connor hasn\'t even managed that. At its core, Rocket sounds like a demo tape with one promising song.', 13),
  new Song('/music/VerucaSalt-Seether.mp3','/img/verucasalt.jpg', 'Seether', 'Veruca Salt', '1994', 'Rock', 'With their thin, singsong vocals and fuzzed-out guitars, Veruca Salt may sound like the Breeders and the Pixies, but lack either band\'s talent for inverting pop conventions or taste for the bizarre. What Veruca Salt has instead is a raw talent for simple, infectious pop songs; the result is a surprisingly fresh fusion of alternative pop and bubblegum. Nina Gordon and Louise Post try hard to inject meaning into the sweet, distorted rush of "Seether," but all that sticks is the infectious melody and crushing guitars. That also applies to the slower songs, from the enchanting lust of "Spiderman \'79" to "Forsythia," which is too close to the Breeders\' Pod for comfort. But musically, American Thighs is surprisingly satisfying; it\'s a pure pop album masquerading as the next big thing.', 14),
  new Song('/music/Radiohead-Creep.mp3','/img/radiohead.jpg', 'Creep', 'Radiohead', '1993', 'Rock', 'Radiohead\'s debut album, Pablo Honey, is a promising collection that blends U2\'s anthemic rock with long, atmospheric instrumental passages and an enthralling triple-guitar attack that is alternately gentle and bracingly noisy. The group has difficulty writing a set of songs that are as compelling as their sound, but when they do hit the mark -- such as on "Anyone Can Play Guitar," "Blow Out," and the self-loathing breakthrough single "Creep" -- the band achieves a rare power that is both visceral and intelligent.', 15),
  new Song('/music/REM-EverybodyHurts.mp3','/img/rem.jpg', 'Everybody Hurts', 'R.E.M.', '1992', 'Rock', 'Turning away from the sweet pop of Out of Time, R.E.M. created a haunting, melancholy masterpiece with Automatic for the People. At its core, the album is a collection of folk songs about aging, death, and loss, but the music has a grand, epic sweep provided by layers of lush strings, interweaving acoustic instruments, and shimmering keyboards. Automatic for the People captures the group at a crossroads, as they moved from cult heroes to elder statesmen, and the album is a graceful transition into their new status. It is a reflective album, with frank discussions on mortality, but it is not a despairing record -- "Nightswimming," "Everybody Hurts," and "Sweetness Follows" have a comforting melancholy, while "Find the River" provides a positive sense of closure. R.E.M. have never been as emotionally direct as they are on Automatic for the People, nor have they ever created music quite as rich and timeless, and while the record is not an easy listen, it is the most rewarding record in their oeuvre.', 16),
  new Song('/music/StoneTemplePilots-Plush.mp3','/img/stonetemplepilots.jpg', 'Plush', 'Stone Temple Pilots', '1992', 'Rock', 'Stone Temple Pilots were positively vilified once their 1992 debut, Core, started scaling the charts in 1993, pegged as fifth-rate Pearl Jam copyists. It is true that the worst moments of Core play like a parody of the Seattle scene -- titles like "Dead and Bloated" and "Crackerman" tell you that much, playing like really bad Alice in Chains parodies, and the entire record tends to sink into gormless post-grunge sludge. Furthermore, even if it rocks pretty hard, it\'s usually without much character, sounding like cut-rate grunge. To be fair, it\'s more that they share the same influences as their peers than being overt copycats, but it\'s still a little disheartening all the same. If that\'s all that Core was, it\'d be as forgettable as Seven Mary Three, but there are the hits that propelled it up the charts, songs that have remarkably stood the test of time to be highlights of their era. "Sex Type Thing" may have a clumsy anti-rape lyric that comes across as misogynist, but it survives on its terrifically lunk-headed riff, while "Wicked Garden" is a surprisingly effective piece of revivalist acid rock. Then, there\'s the slow acoustic crawl of "Creep" that works as well as anything on AIC\'s Sap and, finally, "Plush," a majestic album rock revival more melodic and stylish than anything grunge produced outside of Nirvana itself. These four songs aren\'t enough to salvage a fairly pedestrian debut, but they do find STP to be nimble rock craftsmen when inspiration hits.', 17),
  new Song('/music/SoulAsylum-RunawayTrain.mp3','/img/soulasylum.jpg', 'Runaway Train', 'Soul Asylum', '1992', 'Rock', 'Soul Asylum\'s breakthrough, million-selling Grave Dancers Union yielded the mega-hit "Runaway Train" and put the band in a whole new league; longtime fans were predictably disappointed with the slick results. This is a solid alternative rock record with singer/songwriter/vocalist Dave Pirner upfront, a role he was built for but always seemed to resist until this clear do-or-die moment for the band. Soul Asylum did; however, they never matched the success or consistency of this album. Tracks like "Home Sick" and "New World" bear the roots of the country-rock revival later forged by Son Volt and Wilco, while the angst-ridden "Somebody to Shove" is pure joy Soul Asylum-style.', 18),
  new Song('/music/TheOffspring-SelfEsteem.mp3','/img/offspring.jpg', 'Self Esteem', 'The Offspring', '1994', 'Rock', 'The Offspring\'s second album for Epitaph did the impossible: it landed in the Top Five, unheard of for independent records. The Offspring crossed over due to the raucous, Eastern-tinged single "Come Out and Play," which stopped and started just like Nirvana, only without the Seattle trio\'s recklessness. The record stayed in the charts because the Offspring sounded relentlessly heavy, no matter how much the band claimed to be punk. Their tempos are slower than traditional hardcore, and their attack is as heavy as Metallica. But they acted like they were punk, with odes to no "Self Esteem" and singing about fighting in school. Nothing on the album matches the incessant catchiness of the singles, but Smash is a solid record, filled with enough heavy riffs to keep most teenagers happy.', 19),
  new Song('/music/TheSmashingPumpkins-Disarm.mp3','/img/smashingpumpkins.jpg', 'Disarm', 'The Smashing Pumpkins', '1993', 'Rock', 'While Gish had placed the Smashing Pumpkins on the "most promising artist" list for many, troubles were threatening to break the band apart. Singer/guitarist/leader Billy Corgan was battling a severe case of writer\'s block and was in a deep state of depression brought on by a relationship in turmoil; drummer Jimmy Chamberlin was addicted to hard drugs; and bassist D\'Arcy and guitarist James Iha severed their romantic relationship. The sessions for their sophomore effort, Siamese Dream, were wrought with friction -- Corgan eventually played almost all the instruments himself (except for percussion). Some say strife and tension produces the best music, and it certainly helped make Siamese Dream one of the finest alt-rock albums of all time. Instead of following Nirvana\'s punk rock route, Siamese Dream went in the opposite direction -- guitar solos galore, layered walls of sound courtesy of the album\'s producers (Butch Vig and Corgan), extended compositions that bordered on prog rock, plus often reflective and heartfelt lyrics. The four tracks that were selected as singles became alternative radio standards -- the anthems "Cherub Rock," "Today," and "Rocket," plus the symphonic ballad "Disarm" -- but as a whole, Siamese Dream proved to be an incredibly consistent album. Such compositions as the red-hot rockers "Quiet" and "Geek U.S.A." were standouts, as were the epics "Hummer," "Soma," and "Silverfuck," plus the soothing sounds of "Mayonaise," "Spaceboy," and "Luna." After the difficult recording sessions, Corgan stated publicly that if Siamese Dream didn\'t achieve breakthrough success, he would end the band. He didn\'t have to worry for long -- the album debuted in the Billboard Top Ten and sold more than four million copies in three years. Siamese Dream stands alongside Nevermind and Superunknown as one of the decade\'s finest (and most influential) rock albums.', 20),
  new Song('/music/TheVervePipe-TheFreshmen.mp3','/img/vervepipe.jpg', 'The Freshman', 'The Verve Pipe', '1996', 'Rock', 'The Verve Pipe made their major-label debut under the direction of producer Jerry Harrison with Villains, recasting themselves in the inauspicious mold of a post-grunge act. On an initial listen, the album does little to distinguish itself from the masses, though patient revisiting reveals a band of more depth, with Brian Vander Ark\'s songwriting improving vastly over previous albums and more subtle aspects, like the tasteful organic keyboard arrangements, actually adding texture and dimension to the sound. The band seemed to acknowledge the misstep by re-recording (yet again) "The Freshmen" for single release and subsequent pressings, which ultimately earned them their first national hit.', 21),
  new Song('/music/Tool-Sober.mp3','/img/tool.jpg', 'Sober', 'Tool', '1993', 'Rock', 'Just as grunge was reaching its boiling point and radio-friendly punk-pop loomed on the horizon, Tool released Undertow, which firmly reinforced metal\'s prominence as a musical style -- but, for once, it had something worthwhile to say. At the forefront of Tool\'s commercial explosion were striking, haunting visuals that complemented the album\'s nihilistic yet wistful mood. Drawing equal inspiration from Black Sabbath, alternative theories of science, and Eastern religions, Tool\'s abrasive sonic assault begins from the opening notes and continues through the final moments of the last composition, an open mockery of organized religion and its incapacity for original thought. With its technical brilliance, musical complexities, and aggressive overtones, Undertow not only paved the way for several bands to break through to the mainstream adolescent mall-rage demographic, it also proved that metal could be simultaneously intelligent, emotional, and brutal.', 22),
  new Song('/music/PearlJam-Jeremy.mp3','/img/pearljam.jpg', 'Jeremy', 'Pearl Jam', '1991', 'Rock', 'Nirvana\'s Nevermind may have been the album that broke grunge and alternative rock into the mainstream, but there\'s no underestimating the role that Pearl Jam\'s Ten played in keeping them there.

  new Song('/music/Radiohead-KarmaPolice.mp3','/img/radiohead.jpg', 'Karma Police', 'Radiohead', '1997', 'Rock', 'Using the textured soundscapes of The Bends as a launching pad, Radiohead delivered another startlingly accomplished set of modern guitar rock with OK Computer. The anthemic guitar heroics present on Pablo Honey and even The Bends are nowhere to be heard here. Radiohead have stripped away many of the obvious elements of guitar rock, creating music that is subtle and textured yet still has the feeling of rock & roll. Even at its most adventurous -- such as the complex, multi-segmented "Paranoid Android" -- the band is tight, melodic, and muscular, and Thom Yorke\'s voice effortlessly shifts from a sweet falsetto to vicious snarls. It\'s a thoroughly astonishing demonstration of musical virtuosity and becomes even more impressive with repeated listens, which reveal subtleties like electronica rhythms, eerie keyboards, odd time signatures, and complex syncopations. Yet all of this would simply be showmanship if the songs weren\'t strong in themselves, and OK Computer is filled with moody masterpieces, from the shimmering "Subterranean Homesick Alien" and the sighing "Karma Police" to the gothic crawl of "Exit Music (For a Film)." OK Computer is the album that established Radiohead as one of the most inventive and rewarding guitar rock bands of the \'90s.', 24),
